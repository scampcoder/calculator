# Basic Calculator
A calculator made using JavaScript.

Things I Learned:
* How to defer a JS file to load after all the rest of the page has parsed using "defer"
* How to use "data-attributes" (instead of classes) between HTML and JS files. This helps differentiate between what is being affected by JS and what is being affected by CSS.
* A better understanding of Event Listeners.
* A better understanding of class creation in JS.
* How to select all content in CSS and better select there, in general.
